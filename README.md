# hello-world
My name is Benjamin, and I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. Over the past four years, I've learned a variety of programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, HTML/CSS, and Swift. Additionally, I've gained experience in iOS app development. Currently, I'm particularly interested in cross-platform app development, especially using frameworks such as React Native and Flutter.
